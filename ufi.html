<h1>Dear Ufi:</h1>

<p>Please accept this letter as my application to be a proposal assessor and/or
Ufi expert as described in:

<a href="https://ufi.co.uk/who-we-are/work-with-us/assessors/">who we are - assessors</a>

<p>I have a unique and extensive background in Venture Capital and Education
which demonstrates both my commitment to and experience in this important area.
As Cicero put it:

<q>There is no nobler occupation, nor one more profitable to the State than
educating the rising generation.</q>

<p>You mention the following areas of expertise.  I have provided a sketch of
my experience and capabilities in each area:

<p>You might also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_(Unix)">find</a> my CV relevant to your decision making:

<a href="https://prb.appaapps.com/">CV for Philip R Brenan</a>

<p>(The CV quotes my business address not my residential address).


<h2>Learning design in a digital environment</h2>

<p>I taught English as a second language in Northern Italy for two years. To <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help">help</a> my students to learn English quickly I produced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a> games that used
instructions in English. These games required them to listen to a sentence in
English like "The purple flower in a vase on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)">table</a>" and then click on the
object being described. The software tracked the phrases the student did not
understand and arranged for them to be repeated more often than the phrases the
student did understand correctly.

<p>I later used this basic <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/errata02/os/complete/part3-all-inclusive/langRef/technicalContent/concept.html#concept">concept</a> to produce games that ran on Nokia phones.
Nokia distributed these games, world wide, from their app store. Later I
translated these games to Android and made them available globally via the
Amazon App store.


<h2>Technology development or deployment to support learning</h2>

<p>These days I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship">mentor</a> minority students in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a> programming via <a
href="www.codementor.com">Code Mentor</a>.  Typically I engage with students
who are failing in their studies towards a BSc or MSc degree in Computer
Science and give them one-on-one instruction via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet">gigabit</a> fiber optic Internet
to enable them to catch up and surpass their classmates.

<p>To support these activities I had to persuade my local phone company to run a
special fiber optic connection to my home office to give me the high speed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> required for such activities. I now have mentees spread out across the
world.


<h2>Organizational change using digital tools</h2>

<p>From 1990 to 2005 I led Novosoft Inc., a company that supplied offshore
programmers to companies in the United States during the first Internet
revolution.  This was a highly profitable business because it transformed
business that were failing because they could not obtain programmers at any
price to businesses that were succeeding because they had plentiful access to
skilled programmers at reasonable rates.  Novosoft Inc. included both IBM and
Microsoft among its clients.  Key to this transformation was explaining to
potential clients the benefits of using the Internet to safely distribute their
programming projects away from their home locales to the distant locations
being opened up by the ever expanding Internet.  As an example of this
transformation, IBM used to have 70% of its 300,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment#Employee">employee</a>s onshore, now they
have 70% of them offshore.


<h2>Learner support in distributed learning contexts</h2>

<p>As noted above I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship">mentor</a> minority students in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a> programming via <a
href="https://www.codementor.com">Code Mentor</a>.  These students are widely
distributed around the world.  The insight I gain from reviewing course
materials and teaching techniques with my mentees is helpful as it shows me
what works and what does not work.  For example, over half of Computer Science
graduates cannot write basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">program</a>s when requested to do so.

<p>As also noted above, I have produced over 100 interactive learning games
that have been globally distributed via the Nokia App Store and the Amazon App
Store.  These games are free and so have been widely distributed not just by
the official apps stores but also by pirate distributors.


<h2>Supporting disadvantaged learners using digital tools</h2>

<p>The immersive learning games that I have produced, described above, are
distributed for free and do not require the Internet for operation so any-one
with a basic Nokia or Android phone can play them, world wide, without payment,
in their own time. I have received thank you notes from every continent from
students enjoying these immersive games.


<h2>Work based learning in the UK</h2>

<p>I have no UK specific experience in work based learning other than the
generic experience of mentoring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person">people</a> from the UK alongside students from
other locations without regard to race, colour or creed.

<p>I do have extensive experience in mentoring new hires for US fortune 500
companies. Typically the first year at a new employer is the most difficult to
survive, especially at a large employer. By providing one-on-one mentoring I
ensure that my mentees make good use of the resources in their new
organization, respond to work requests promptly, engage with their colleagues
effectively and get recognized for their contributions. I used to work for the
most profitable company ever to exist (Arabian American Oil) which gave me an
excellent background in dealing with such issues in a very diverse multi
national environment.


<h2>Further Education, Apprenticeships and vocational qualifications in the UK</h2>

<p>As noted above, I do not have UK specific experience.


<h2>International EdTech development</h2>

<p>As noted above I have extensive experience teaching English as a second
language via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a> games that I devised and later published. I also have
extensive experience mentoring Computer Science students during their final
years at university and during their first few years at work.

<p>I have also attended numerous online educational courses so that I could
experience the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)">process</a> of online learning as a student rather than as a
teacher. The results were profoundly illuminating.


<h2>Business development in the digital learning world</h2>

<p>I have made numerous attempts to develop digital learning businesses.

<p>The great difficulty in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management">arena</a> is that students do not have either the
money to buy educational material nor the skill to choose appropriate material.

<p>Expensive textbooks are available for free download online, for instance:

<a href="https://b-ok.xyz/">Free text books</a>

<p>Thus the Internet gives with one hand by making it possible to reach many
more students, but at the same time, it takes with the other hand by removing
the profit motive from the equation by making all educational resources free.


<h2>Financial investment in digital learning businesses</h2>

<p>The most effective way I have discovered so far of disseminating experience
and learning in a work environment is to pair <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship">mentor</a>s (particularly retirees)
with mentees (typically 18-25 year old students) so that the student always has
an experienced partner at hand to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help">help</a> them learn and to adapt to their new
educational and corporate environments. As Socrates said: "You cannot argue
with a book".  But you can argue most effectively with your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship">mentor</a>, and in
arguing with them (in the legal sense of argumentation) one can learn very
effectively.

<p>This technique does not take a lot of financial investment other than in
setting up the necessary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a> hardware (camera, monitor) and the necessary
communications equipment, (fiber optic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet">gigabit</a> internet).

<p>Each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship">mentor</a> can support about 10 students. Once connected together, the use
of free online tools such as <a href="https://sketch.io/sketchpad/">Sketch
Pad</a> and <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com">Tinker Cad</a> provide powerful
ways for mentee and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship">mentor</a> to communicate complex ideas.

<p>Each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship">mentor</a> in turn should be able to call on the services of other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship">mentor</a>s in order to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help">help</a> them overcome any unexpected difficulties or gaps in their
knowledge.

<h2>Operational experience in early-stage venture capital backed business</h2>

<p>My involvement with Novosoft Inc (as noted above) was primarily as an early
stage venture capitalist, in that I invested time (hence money) to bring
software ideas I judged valuable to fruition so that I could profit at the exit
(IPO or buyout) from stock options acquired earlier on when they were less
valuable.
