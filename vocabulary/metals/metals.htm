<h1>Common Metals and Their Importance</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Iron</h2> <p>Iron is one of the most abundant metals on Earth and
        is crucial in various industries including construction,
        transportation, and manufacturing. It is used to make steel, which is a
        vital component in buildings, bridges, vehicles, and machinery.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Aluminum</h2> <p>Aluminum is lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and
        highly conductive, making it essential in aerospace, automotive, and
        construction industries. It is used in aircraft, cars, window frames,
        and packaging materials.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Copper</h2> <p>Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity and
        heat, making it indispensable in electrical wiring, electronics, and
        plumbing systems. It is also used in roofing, coins, and various
        industrial applications.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Zinc</h2> <p>Zinc is primarily used as a protective coating for
        steel to prevent corrosion, a process known as galvanization. It is
        also utilized in batteries, alloys, and as a dietary supplement.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Gold</h2> <p>Gold has been valued for its beauty and rarity for
        centuries and is widely used in jewelry, investment, and as a store of
        value. It also has applications in electronics, dentistry, and
        aerospace technology.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Silver</h2> <p>Silver is highly conductive and has antibacterial
        properties, making it valuable in electronics, photography, and medical
        applications such as wound dressings and surgical instruments.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Lead</h2> <p>Lead is dense and has excellent shielding properties
        against radiation, making it suitable for use in batteries, ammunition,
        and construction materials. However, its toxic nature has led to
        restrictions on its use in many applications.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Tin</h2> <p>Tin is commonly used as a coating for other metals to
        prevent corrosion. It is also used in the production of solder, which
        is essential in electronics manufacturing for joining components.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Bronze</h2> <p>Bronze is an alloy primarily composed of copper and
        tin, though other elements may also be present. It is valued for its
        strength, durability, and resistance to corrosion, making it ideal for
        sculptures, musical instruments, and architectural elements.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
