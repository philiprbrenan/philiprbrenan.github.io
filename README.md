[Amazon App Store](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=appaapps).

Managed the development an extension to
[JPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) to enable very large images to
be displayed at high resolution in realistic motion on Android devices
to create immersive educational games.

Developed a
[CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) pipeline

As a Software Development Manager I managed team of ten remote
programmers to develop an LR(1) parser in [The C Programming
Language](https://1lib.eu/book/633119/db5c78) to
[parse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) [Structured Query

go public on the strength of this innovation.

As a physics programmer, I designed and developed software written in
[Programming Language One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I) to
simulate the [Neutral Beam
Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral-beam_injection) systems
at [Joint European
Torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_European_Torus) responsible
for heating the fusion plasma to 100 million degrees centigrade as
described in [Physics design calculations for the JET neutral
injectors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978008025697950052X).
This system enabled physicists to describe three dimensional objects in
the neutral injection assembly then calculate the power deposition on
these objects and displayed the results graphically, allowing
theâ€¯physics design team to evaluate new plasma heating system
configurations more quickly and cost effectively than live testing with
expensive and radioactive
[tritium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium).

1.  ##### GitHub

    I am a member of the [GitHub Developer
    Program](https://github.com/philiprbrenan) and an active
    [user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)) of
    [GitHub](https://github.com/philiprbrenan) with over 33K
    contributions in the last year alone across 104 repositories.

2.  ##### Perl.

    Please see my Perl
    [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)
    [Data::Table::Text](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Table::Text)
    which I wrote to spread work across multiple instances running on
    [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com)
    [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) while converting all **1719** of
    [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html)
    \'s manuals describing their operations from
    [DocBook](https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.1/)
    [Xml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) to
    [Dita](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/part2-tech-content/dita-v1.3-os-part2-tech-content.html)
    [Xml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) as noted in this email:

    ![](http://philiprbrenan.appaapps.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/HPE.png){#hpe}

3.  ##### Python.

    I have published this [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming):
    [Vectors In Two Dimensions](https://pypi.org/project/Vector2/). I
    [mentor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship) new programmers
    in [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming on
    [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/@philiprbrenan) using my
    [gigabit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet)
    [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) connection. One
    of my mentees recently won a university scholarship as a result of
    our [Python](https://www.python.org/) [pair
    programing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) efforts.

4.  ##### Postgres.

    I created this [github](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/postgres)
    repository to demonstrate various ways of connecting to
    [Postgres](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/postgres). I have
    written [Structured Query
    Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) for
    [Postgres](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/postgres),
    [DB2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Db2_Family) and
    [MySql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL).

5.  ##### Back-end applications programming.

    I have programmed in [The Java Programming
    Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)),
    [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Perl](http://www.perl.org/),
    [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) on [Amazon
    Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) since 2010: As an example: this
    document contains buttons to reverse the order of its sections and
    the experience sections can be dragged into a different order.

6.  ##### Highly available product systems

    I worked as a database administrator at
    [Transamerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transamerica_Corporation)
    managing their online payment and accounting system systems running
    on [IBM System 390](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/390)
    for 5 years.

7.  ##### Automated testing (unit, functional etc.)

    I have published 57 [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) modules on
    [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/PRBRENAN) each of which makes
    extensive use of automated testing. These modules are also present
    on GitHub where they are tested using a [GitHub
    Action](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/DataTableText/actions).

8.  ##### Knowledge of Linux/Unix

    I use [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) on my local systems and
    [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) when on [Amazon Web
    Services](http://aws.amazon.com) - the ability to move work to and
    from identical local and remote
    [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) operating
    systems is conducive to getting work done with dispatch.

9.  ##### Parsing text.

    I wrote [Data::Edit::Xml](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Edit::Xml)
    to [parse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) the
    [Xml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) in all of the **1719**
    manuals written by [Hewlett Packard
    Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html) describing their
    operations so that I could convert them from
    [DocBook](https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.1/)
    [Xml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) to
    [Dita](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/os/part2-tech-content/dita-v1.3-os-part2-tech-content.html)
    [Xml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) as noted above.

10. ##### Payment gateways API implementation

    I recently set up a payment which connects to the New Jersey
    Department of Agriculture to allow vets to pay bills via credit
    cards.
