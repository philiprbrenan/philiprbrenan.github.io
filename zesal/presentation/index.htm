<p><b>Problem:</b> dataCenters use a lot of electricity.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> a specialized chip to look up data much more efficiently.</p>

<p>Performance independently measured by openroad for a

versus a generic processor on a <b>2/3</b> Keys per leaf/branch btree .  The
performance gap widens significantly as we increase the number of Keys in each

<h2 id="problem">The problem</h2>

<p>dataCenters consume more electricity than they really need to.</p>

<p><q>dataCenters use one hundred times as much electricity as most other
businesses do</q>, according to the wsj.

<p><img src="images/DataCentersUseALotOfElectricity.jpg">

<p>dataCenters consume about <b>300</b> Terawatt hours per year or <b>1%</b>
of world electricity production.</p>

<p><img src="images/GlobalElectricityProduction.jpg">

<p>And this amount is steadily increasing year by year.</p>

<p><img src="images/PowerConsumptionOfMajorTechCompanies.png"/>

<p>About equal to the combined total electricity consumed by these major
cities:</p>

<p>As a consequence, dataCenter operators like to locate themselves close to
reliable supplies of cheap electricity. For example, <i>Gmail</i> is located
near the Bonneville Dam in The Cascades, on the River Columbia, in Oregon.</p>

<p><img src="images/BonnevilleDam.jpg"/>

<p>Global electricity production currently amounts to $2 trillion annually -
equivalent to the gdp of Italy.</p>

<p><img src="images/Italy.jpg"/>

<h2 id="solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>Appa Apps Inc. is prototyping databaseOnAChip, a specialized silicon
chip for use in Data Centers to perform database look-ups <b>10</b> times
faster while using <b>10</b> times less electricity than the generic computers
currently in use. </p>

<p><img src="images/AppaAppsIsPrototypingASiliconChip.jpg">

<p>dataCenters do a lot of database look-ups. Every company has a database
nowadays and every company spends lots of time and money looking stuff up in
their database, quickly, because their customers demand it.</p>

<p><img src="images/EveryCompanyHasADatabase.jpg">

<p>If we could make database look-ups just a bit more efficient, dataCenter
operators would save quite a lot of money on their huge electricity bills - a
saving of perhaps <b>$100 million</b> per year.</p>

<h2>This is not a new idea...</h2>

<p>Today, everyone has a mobile phone with a gpu implemented in silicon rather
than software because the original, software-only versions were far too slow.
And every personal computer has a gpu for much the same reason.</p>

<p><img id=phones src="images/EvolutionOfMobilePhone.png">

<p>Bitcoin mining used to be done using just software. At one time you could
easily mine a few bitcoins every day with a generic notebook computer. Now, you
need to use a factory full of specialized Bitcoin miners that do most of their
processing in silicon rather than in software.</p>

<p><img src="images/BitCoinMiner.jpg">

<p>Implementing database software effectively in silicon will help dataCenter
operators be more competitive by reducing the cost and time spent doing
database look-ups.</p>

<h2 id="ptr">Prototype Test Results</h2>

<p><img id="tugOfWar" src="images/SpecializedVersusGeneric.jpg">
<p class="rattler"> 1845: HMS Rattler (propeller) vs HMS Alecto (paddle wheels). Rattler pulled Alecto backwards, proving propellers are more effective than paddle wheels.

<p>Appa Apps Inc. has recently succeeded in synthesizing and routing a verilog
version of the well known btree database algorithm normally written in the cpl
ready for placement on an asic .

<h3>The custom processor is <b>62</b> * better than a generic processor !</h3>

<p>Performance as measured by openroad for the custom cpu versus a generic cpu
on a <b>2/3</b> Keys per leaf/branch btree .  The performance gets even better
as we increase the number of Keys in each branch and leaf of the btree .

<p>In the above <b>area</b> in micrometers squared equates to <b>power</b>
consumption while <b>frequency</b> in megahertz equates to <b>execution
speed</b>. And even better a find operation takes far fewer statements to
execute on the custom cpu than it does on the generic cpu because the custom

<h3>Custom CPU </h3>

<h3>Generic CPU</h3>

btree algorithm as produced by openroad .</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philiprbrenan/btreeBlock/refs/heads/main/generic/find.png">

<h3>Field Programmable Gate Array Version</h3>

<p>We have also been able to run the <b>find</b> action successfully on an fpga:

<p><img id="gowin" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philiprbrenan/btreeBlock/refs/heads/main/presentation/images/first_light_doc_nano9K.jpg">

<p>In the image, the power light is the <b>LED</b> at the bottom, then reading
up the first <b>4</b> LEDs from the power LED having values <b>8, 4, 2, 1</b>
are signalling that the data associated with key <b></b> is <b>4</b> or in
binary:

<pre>
<b>P 0100F0</b>
</pre>

<p>where <b>F</b> is powered on showing that the key was successfully found in
the btree .

<h1>Seed Round</h1>

<p>We aim to raise <b>$1 million</b> for a seed round to produce a prototype
working asic to show to the major dataCenter operators as proof of
concept. This will involve:</p>

<ol>

<li>Hiring hardware engineers to convert our prototype from an fpga to a taped
out asic mask.

<li>Adding the mask to a multi project wafer to get a small number of chips
built to confirm our design functions as expected.

<li>Testing the fabrication results and iterating as needed.

<li>Hiring sales and marketing personnel to present our findings to the major
dataCenter operators with the goal of getting letters of intent from them to
buy chips based on our design.

<p><img src="images/LetterOfIntent.jpg">

<li>Use the letters of intent to buy such chips to raise an <b>A</b> funding
round

<li>Go into full scale production at our favorite silicon foundry.

</ol>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3 id="whoIsAppaApps">Who is Appa Apps Inc?</h3>

<p>Just me and chatgpt </p>

<p><img src="images/JustMeAndChatGpt.jpg">

<p>chatgpt is very useful as it does all the boring low-level coding, letting
me concentrate on the problem of what, exactly, should be coded.

<p>Appa Apps Inc. is a class <b>C</b> corporation registered in Austin,
Texas.</p>

<h3 id="traction">Do you have any traction?</h3>

<p>No, none at all. Just creating the prototype has occupied me fully for the
last two years with no time off for anything else.

<h3 id="whyNow">Why now?</h3>

<ul>

<li>Moore's law has come to an end so generic chips are starting to give way to
specialist chips.</li>

<li>The ai boom is creating lots of spare fabrication capacity at the
semiconductor foundries that produce chips.</li>

<li>ai makes it possible to explore the myriad chip design possibilities much
more easily than ever before.</li>

<li>Recent availability of the siliconCompiler makes designing specialized
chips easier than ever before.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="businessModel">What is your business model?</h3>

<p>Our business model is a pure Intellectual Property play. We would license
the copyright to our design, allowing foundries to fabricate specialized
silicon chips to replace the generic ones currently in use fordatabaselookups
in dataCenters. This approach mirrors the business model of industry leaders
such as NVIDIA, ARM, and Qualcomm.</p>

<h3 id="customers">Who would be your customers?</h3>

<p>Our ideal customers are the top 10 hyperscale dataCenter operators, such
as:

<ol>
<li class="hsc">Amazon Web Services
<li class="hsc">Microsoft Azure
<li class="hsc">Google Cloud Platform
<li class="hsc">Alibaba Cloud
<li class="hsc">IBM Cloud
<li class="hsc">Oracle Cloud
<li class="hsc">Tencent Cloud
<li class="hsc">Huawei Cloud
</ol>
</p>

<h3 id="whywanted">How do you know the hyperscalers want your solution?</h3>

<p>Hyperscalers have enormous electricity bills, which is why they
strategically locate their dataCenters near hydroelectric dams and nuclear
power stations. They are well aware of the need to reduce electricity costs, as
their shareholders demand it. As a result, they must invest in the most cost
effective chips available. There is no other alternative except going out of
business.

<h3 id="whyBest">Why are you the best team?</h3>

<p>We are the best team to bring this solution to market because we have
succeeded in producing a routable verilog design when no else seems to have
done so.  We are just combining the ideas in these books: specialized chips and continuous improvement.
