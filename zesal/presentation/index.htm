<h2 id="xxx">The problem</h2>

<p>dataCenters consume more electricity than they really need to.</p>

<p><q>dataCenters use one hundred times as much electricity as most other
businesses do</q>, according to the wsj.

<p><img src="images/DataCentersUseALotOfElectricity.jpg">

<p>dataCenters consume about <b>300</b> Tera Watt hours per year or <b>1%</b>
of world electricity production.</p>

<p><img src="images/GlobalElectricityProduction.jpg">

<p>And this amount is steadily increasing year by year.</p>

cities:</p>

<p>As a consequence, dataCenter operators like to locate themselves close to
reliable supplies of cheap electricity. For example, <i>Gmail</i> is located
near the Bonneville Dam in The Cascades, on the River Columbia, in Oregon.</p>

<p><img src="images/BonnevilleDam.jpg"/>

<p>Global electricity production currently amounts to $2 trillion annually -
equivalent to the gdp of Italy.</p>

<p><img src="images/Italy.jpg"/>

<h2 id="xxx">The Solution</h2>

<p>Appa Apps Inc. is prototyping a specialized silicon chip for use in Data
Centers to performdatabaselook-ups <b>10</b> times faster while using
<b>10</b> times less electricity than the generic computers currently in use.
</p>

<p><img src="images/AppaAppsIsPrototypingASiliconChip.jpg">

<p>dataCenters do a lot of database look-ups. Every company has a database
nowadays and every company spends lots of time and money looking stuff up in
their database, quickly, because their customers demand it.</p>

<p><img src="images/EveryCompanyHasADatabase.jpg">

<p>If we could make database look-ups just a bit more efficient, dataCenter
operators would save quite a lot of money on their huge electricity bills - a
saving of perhaps <b>$100 million</b> per year.</p>

<h2>This is not a new idea...</h2>

<p>Today, everyone has a mobile phone with a gpu implemented in silicon rather
thansoftware because the original, software-only versions were far too slow.
And every personal computer has a gpu for much the same reason.</p>

<p><img src="images/EvolutionOfMobilePhone.png">

<p>Bitcoin mining used to be done using just software. At one time you could
easily mine a few bitcoins every day with a generic notebook computer. Now, you
need to use a factory full of specialized Bitcoin miners that do most of their
processing in silicon rather than in software.</p>

<p><img src="images/BitCoinMiner.jpg">

<p>Implementing database software effectively in silicon will help dataCenter
operators be more competitive by reducing the cost and time spent doing
database look-ups.</p>

<h2 id="xxx">Prototype Retest Results</h2>

<p>Appa Apps Inc. has recently succeeded in synthesizing and routing a Verilog

In the above **area** in micro meters squared equates to **power** consumption
while **frequency** in mega hertz equates to **execution speed**. And even
better a find operation takes far fewer statements to execute on the custom cpu
than it does on the generic cpu because the operation codes are so much better
adapted to manipulating a btree .

<p>We aim to raise <b>$1 million</b> for a seed round to:</p>

<ol>

<li>Buy the hardware necessary to demonstrate our technology,</li>

<li>Hire hardware engineers to implement our technology as an
fpga connected to the real world via ethernet and usb,</li>

<li>Hire sales and marketing personnel to present our findings to the major
operators with the goal of getting letters of intent from them to buy chips
based on our design.</li>

</ol>

<p><img src="images/LetterOfIntent.jpg">

<p>If they provide letters of intent to buy such chips, we will use them to
drive a large Series <b>A</b> funding round to convert the fpga into an asic

database look-ups even more effectively.</p>

<h2 id="xxx">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3 id="xxx">Who is Appa Apps Inc?</h3>

<p>Just me and chatgpt </p>

<p><img src="images/JustMeAndChatGpt.jpg">

<p>chatgpt is very useful as it does all the boring low-level coding, letting
me concentrate on the problem of what, exactly, should be coded.

<p>Appa Apps Inc. is a class <b>C</b> corporation registered in Austin,
Texas.</p>

<h3 id="xxx">Do you have any traction?</h3>

<p>No, none at all. Just creating the prototype has occupied me fully for the
last two years with no time off for anything else.

<h3 id="xxx">Why now?</h3>

<ul>

<li>Moore's law has come to an end so generic chips are starting to give way to
specialist chips.</li>

<li>The ai boom is creating lots of spare fabrication capacity at the
semiconductor foundries that produce chips.</li>

<li>ai makes it possible to explore the myriad chip design possibilities much
more easily than ever before.</li>

<li>Recent availability of the siliconCompiler makes designing specialized
chips easier than ever before.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="xxx">What is your business model?</h3>

<p>Our business model is a pure Intellectual Property play. We would license
the copyright to our design, allowing foundries to fabricate specialized
silicon chips to replace the generic ones currently in use fordatabaselookups
in dataCenters. This approach mirrors the business model of industry leaders
such as NVIDIA, ARM, and Qualcomm.</p>

<h3 id="xxx">Who would be your customers?</h3>

<p>Our ideal customers are the top 10 hyperscale dataCenter operators, such
as:

<ol>
<li>Amazon Web Services
<li>Microsoft Azure
<li>Google Cloud Platform
<li>Alibaba Cloud
<li>IBM Cloud
<li>Oracle Cloud
<li>Tencent Cloud
<li>Huawei Cloud
</ol>
</p>

<h3 id="xxx">How do you know the hyperscalers want your solution?</h3>

<p>Hyperscalers have enormous electricity bills, which is why they
strategically locate their dataCenters near hydroelectric dams and nuclear
power stations. They are well aware of the need to reduce electricity costs, as
their shareholders demand it. As a result, they must invest in the most cost
effective chips available. There is no other alternative except going out of
business.

<h3 id="xxx">Why are you the best team?</h3>

<p>We are the best team to bring this solution to market because we have
succeeded in producing routable Verilog when no else seems to have done so.

<h3 id="xxx">How can we best support your business?</h3>

<p>We need help in presenting our prototype effectively to the right people who
are capable of making investment decisions.
