<h1 id="xxx">Database on a Chip</h1>

<p>Data centers: save money on your electricity bills with <b>Database on a Chip</b>.

Performance as measured by openroad for a custom cpu versus a generic cpu on a
2/3 keys per leaf/branch btree .  The performance gap widens significantly as
we increase the number of keys in each branch and leaf towards 2**20/2**20+1
leaf/branch btree.

<table cellpadding=10 border=1>
<tr><th colspan=2>Area um2<th colspan=2>Fmax MHz<th colspan=2>Statements
<tr><th>Custom<th>Generic <th>Custom<th>Generic<th>Custom<th>Generic
<tr><td>2467<td>12927<td>902<td>399<td>23<td>122
<tr><td colspan=2> 5.24 x Smaller<td colspan=2> 2.26 x Faster<td colspan=2> 5.30 * Compact Code
<tr><td colspan=4 style="text-align: center;"><b>62.76</b> x better
</table>

In the above **area** in micro meters squared equates to **power** consumption
while **frequency** in mega hertz equates to **execution speed**. And even
better a find operation takes far fewer statements to execute on the custom cpu
than it does on the generic cpu because the operation codes are so much better
adapted to manipulating a btree .

<h2 id="xxx">The problem</h2>

<p>Data centers consume more electricity than they really need to.</p>

<p><q>Data centers use one hundred times as much electricity as most other
businesses do</q>, according to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/">The Wall Street Journal</a>.

<p><img src="images/DataCentersUseALotOfElectricity.jpg">

<p>Data centers consume about <b>300</b> Tera Watt hours per year or <b>1%</b>
of world electricity production.</p>

<p><img src="images/GlobalElectricityProduction.jpg">

<p>And this amount is steadily increasing year by year.</p>

<p><img src="images/PowerConsumptionOfMajorTechCompanies.png"/>

<p>About equal to the combined total electricity consumed by these major
cities:</p>

<p>As a consequence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center operators like to locate themselves close to
reliable supplies of cheap electricity. For example, <i>Gmail</i> is located
near the Bonneville Dam in The Cascades, on the River Columbia, in Oregon.</p>

<p><img src="images/BonnevilleDam.jpg"/>

<p>Global electricity production currently amounts to $2 trillion annually -
equivalent to the gdp of Italy.</p>

<p><img src="images/Italy.jpg"/>

<h2 id="xxx">The Solution</h2>

<p>Appa Apps Inc. is prototyping a specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> for use in Data
Centers to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups <b>10</b> times faster while using
<b>10</b> times less electricity than the generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>s currently in use.
</p>

<p><img src="images/AppaAppsIsPrototypingASiliconChip.jpg">

<p>Data centers do a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups. Every company has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>
nowadays and every company spends lots of time and money looking stuff up in
their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>, quickly, because their customers demand it.</p>

<p><img src="images/EveryCompanyHasADatabase.jpg">

<p>If we could make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a> more efficient, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center
operators would save quite a lot of money on their huge electricity bills - a
saving of perhaps <b>$100 million</b> per year.</p>

<h2>This is not a new idea...</h2>

<p>Today, everyone has a mobile phone with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">Graphics Processing Unit</a> implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> rather
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> because the original, software-only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">version</a>s were far too slow.
And every personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a> has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">Graphics Processing Unit</a> for much the same reason.</p>

<p><img src="images/EvolutionOfMobilePhone.png">

<p>Bitcoin mining used to be done using just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>. At one time you could
easily mine a few bitcoins every day with a generic notebook <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>. Now, you
need to use a factory full of specialized Bitcoin miners that do most of their
processing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> rather than in software.</p>

<p><img src="images/BitCoinMiner.jpg">

<p>Implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> effectively in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help">help</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center
operators be more competitive by reducing the cost and time spent doing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups.</p>

<h2 id="xxx">Roadmap</h2>

<p>Appa Apps Inc. has recently succeeded in synthesizing a Verilog <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">version</a> of
the well known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> algorithm normally written in <b>C</b> ready for
programming into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a> (FPGA). Nobody else seems to have been able
to do this yet otherwise we would be able to buy their solution on the open
market.</p>

<p><img src="images/fpga.jpg">

<p>We are going to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a> to compare the performance of our specialized
implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> algorithm with the performance of a generic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>, likewise implemented on the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a>, running the <b>C</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">version</a>
of the algorithm.</p>

<p><img id="tugOfWar" src="images/SpecializedVersusGeneric.jpg">

<p>Hopefully our specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a> implementation will be able to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>
look-ups significantly faster while using less power than the comparable
implementation on a generic computer.</p>

<p>If it can, we want to send the major operators copies of the programmed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a>
mounted on a board so that they can plug it in and see for themselves that they
are currently wasting money, needlessly, on their huge electricity bills
because they are not using using our technology. Their share holders will
demand that they do!</p>

<p><img src="images/DatabaseOnAnFPGA.png">

<p>We aim to raise <b>$1 million</b> for a seed round to:</p>

<ol>

<li>Buy the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">hardware</a> necessary to demonstrate our technology,</li>

<li>Hire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">hardware</a> engineers to implement our technology as an actual programmed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a> connected to the real world via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a> and usb,</li>

<li>Hire sales and marketing personnel to present our findings to the major
operators with the goal of getting letters of intent from them to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s
based on our design.</li>

</ol>

<p><img src="images/LetterOfIntent.jpg">

<p>If they provide letters of intent to buy such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s, we will use them to
drive a large Series <b>A</b> funding round to convert the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a> into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">application specific integrated circuit</a>
implemented on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s to reduce the time and electricity consumed doing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups even more effectively.</p>

<h2 id="xxx">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3 id="xxx">Who is Appa Apps Inc?</h3>

<p>Just me and <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation">Chat GPT</a> </p>

<p><img src="images/JustMeAndChatGpt.jpg">

<p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation">Chat GPT</a> is very useful as it does all the boring low-level coding, letting
me concentrate on the problem of what, exactly, should be coded.

<p>Appa Apps Inc. is a class <b>C</b> corporation registered in Austin,
Texas.</p>

<h3 id="xxx">Do you have any traction?</h3>

<p>No, none at all. Just creating the prototype has occupied me fully for the
last two years with no time off for anything else.

<h3 id="xxx">Why now?</h3>

<ul>

<li>Moore's law has come to an end so generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s are starting to give way to
specialist chips.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> boom is creating lots of spare fabrication capacity at the
semiconductor foundries that produce chips.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> makes it possible to explore the myriad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> design possibilities much
more easily than ever before.</li>

<li>Recent availability of the <a
href="https://docs.siliconcompiler.com/en/latest/index.html">Open Source
Silicon Compiler</a> makes designing specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s easier than ever
before.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="xxx">What is your business model?</h3>

<p>Our business model is a pure Intellectual Property play. We would license
the copyright to our design, allowing foundries to fabricate specialized
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s to replace the generic ones currently in use for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> lookups
in Data Centers. This approach mirrors the business model of industry leaders
such as NVIDIA, ARM, and Qualcomm.</p>

<h3 id="xxx">Who would be your customers?</h3>

<p>Our ideal customers are the top 10 hyperscale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center operators, such

<li>Tencent Cloud
<li>Huawei Cloud
</ol>
</p>

<h3 id="xxx">How do you know the hyperscalers want your solution?</h3>

<p>Hyperscalers have enormous electricity bills, which is why they
strategically locate their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers near hydroelectric dams and nuclear
power stations. They are well aware of the need to reduce electricity costs, as
their shareholders demand it. As a result, they must invest in the most cost
effective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s available. There is no other alternative except going out of
business.

<h3 id="xxx">Why are you the best team?</h3>

<p>We are the best team to bring this solution to market because we have many
years of unique, specialized expertise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> and electronics
