<h2 id="xxx">The problem</h2>

<p>Data centers use one hundred times as much power as other businesses do,
according to the Wall Street Journal.

<p><img src="images/DataCentersUseALotOfElectricity.jpg">

<p>And this percentage is steadily increasing year by year.</p>

<p><img src="images/PowerConsumptionOfMajorTechCompanies.png"/>

<p>That is equal to the combined total amount of electricity consumed by these
major global cities:</p>

<p>As a consequence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center operators like to locate their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers
close to reliable supplies of cheap electricity. For example, Gmail is located
near the Bonneville Dam in The Cascades, on the River Columbia, in Oregon.</p>

<p><img src="images/BonnevilleDam.jpg"/>

<p>Global electricity production currently amounts to $2 trillion annually -
equivalent to the GDP of Italy.</p>

<p><img src="images/Italy.jpg"/>

<p>Data centers do a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups. Every company has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> and
every company spends lots of time and money looking stuff up in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>,
quickly, for their demanding customers.</p>

<p><img src="images/EveryCompanyHasADatabase.jpg">

<h2 id="xxx">The Solution</h2>

<p>If we could make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups more efficient, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers would save a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a> of money on their huge electricity bills - perhaps $100 million per year.</p>

<p>Appa Apps Inc. is prototyping a specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> to perform
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups 10 times faster while using 10 times less electricity
than generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>s do.</p>

<p><img src="images/AppaAppsIsPrototypingASiliconChip.jpg">

<h2>This is not a new idea...</h2>

<p>Today, everyone has a mobile phone with a graphics processing unit (GPU)
implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> because the original, software-only
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">version</a>s were too slow. And every personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a> has a GPU for much the same
reason.</p>

<p><img src="images/EvolutionOfMobilePhone.png">

<p>Bitcoin mining used to be done using just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>. At one time you could
easily mine a few bitcoins every day with a generic notebook <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>. Now, you
need to use a factory full of specialized Bitcoin miners that do most of their
processing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> rather than in software.</p>

<p><img src="images/BitCoinMiner.jpg">

<p>Implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> effectively in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help">help</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> center
operators be more competitive by reducing the cost and time spent doing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups.</p>

<p>Appa Apps Inc. has recently succeeded in synthesizing a Verilog <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">version</a> of
the well known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> algorithm normally written in <b>C</b> ready for
programming into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a> (FPGA).</p>

<p><img src="images/fpga.jpg">

<h2 id="xxx">Roadmap</h2>

<p>We are going to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a> mounted on a card to compare the performance of
our specialized implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> algorithm with the performance
of a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>, implemented on the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a>, running the same algorithm.</p>

<p><img id="tugOfWar" src="images/SpecializedVersusGeneric.jpg">

<p>Assuming our specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a> implementation can do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups
significantly faster using less power than the comparable generic
implementation: we are going to send the major operators copies of the
programmed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a> mounted on a card so that they can plug it in and see for
themselves that they are currently wasting money, needlessly, on their
electricity bills because they are not using using our technology.</p>

<p><img src="images/DatabaseOnAnFPGA.png">

<p>We aim to raise $1M to:

<ol>

<li>Buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">hardware</a> to demonstrate our technology,

<li>Hire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">hardware</a> engineers to implement our technology on that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">hardware</a> as an
actual programmed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">Field Programmable Gate Array</a> connected to the real world via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>,

<li>Hire sales and marketing personnel to present our findings to the major
operators with the goal of getting letters of intent from them to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s
based on our design.

</ol>

<p><img src="images/LetterOfIntent.jpg">

<p>If they do provide letters of intent to buy such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s, we will use those
letters to drive a large Series <b>A</b> funding round and get into the
business of saving our planet by reducing the electricity consumed doing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look-ups while making a lot of money.</p>

<h2 id="xxx">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3 id="xxx">Who is Appa Apps Inc?</h3>

<p>Just me and <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation">Chat GPT</a> </p>

<p><img src="images/JustMeAndChatGpt.jpg">

<p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation">Chat GPT</a> is very useful as it does all the  boring low-level coding letting
me concentrate on the problem of what, exactly, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">code</a>.

<p>Appa Apps Inc. is a class <b>C</b> corporation registered in Austin,
Texas.</p>

<h3 id="xxx">Do you have any traction?</h3>

<p>No, none at all. Just creating the prototype has occupied me fully for the
last two years with no time off for anything else.

<h3 id="xxx">Why now?</h3>

<ul>

<li>Moore's law has come to an end so generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s are starting to give way to
specialist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s.

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> boom is creating lots of spare fabrication capacity at the
semiconductor foundrys that produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s.

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> makes it possible to explore the myriad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> design possibilities much
more easily than ever before.
