<h2 id="pomo">Problem or Market Opportunity</h2>

<p>High speed, low power database system on a chip.  The need for faster
graphics produced the gpu industry. The need to secure crypto currencies
produced the bitcoin miner industry.  Most commercial data processing is about
looking stuff up.  There is an opportunity to build asic chips that do database
look ups and sell them to cloudComputing companies on the basis that they will
lower their electricity bills.

<h2 id="sptbd">Solution/Product to be Developed</h2>

<p>An asic mask for a chip dedicated to high speed data look up and a working
chip produced from that mask. Obviously a working silicon sample whose
performance could be measured would be a crucial proof that doc has value.</p>

<h2 id="uosis">Use of Semiconductors in Solution</h2>

<p> Layers of flashMemory and sram integrated in a vertical stack with close to
memory processing using conventional logic gates to perform high speed database
look ups on the stored data.  Chips connected to each other via optical
ethernet in parallel to provide scale and at GHz transmission rates with the
outside world.

<h2 id="coec">Current or Expected Customers</h2>

<p> cloudComputing data centers with large electricity bills.</p>

<h2 id="pms">Potential Market Size</h2>

<p>According to the <a
href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-information-overview/electricity-production">IEA</a>
world production of electricity is: <b>1e13 KWh</b> per year. Data centers use
about <b>1%</b> of that electricity.  Say we could reduce data center
electricity usage by <b>1%</b> that would save <b>10e9 KWh</b> annually.  A
<b>KWh</b> costs approximately <b>US$1e-1</b>. This would yield a gross savings
of <b>US$1e8</b> per year.

<p>Assuming that the price of operating a chip is <b>$10</b> per chip per year
and that we need <b>1e6</b> chips to support this reduction is electricity
usage, then there are potential savings of <b>US$90 million</b> per year.
Splitting the savings with the cloudComputing data center  industry ensures that they
make savings of <b>US$45</b> million per year which might be enough to
incentivise them to use this technology while leaving room for <b>US$45
million</b> in profits annually for the mask rights holder.

<p>The preceding deals only with power savings.  Being able to look things up
faster than a competitor might well bestow unexpected benefits which
might make such chips valuable in as yet unknown applications, perhaps, for
example: analyzing the movements of the stock market. If such unexpected
benefits did materialize then the capability to produce such chips at scale would be
that much more the profitable.

<h2 id="dybm">Describe Your Business Model</h2>

<p>Payments for the right to use the mask describing the asic to produce chips
for sales to cloudComputing data centers.

<h2 id="caa">Competitors & Alternatives</h2>

<p>The alternative is to continue to use generic cpus to look up data in
conventional memory. While mooresLaw was still in effect it was too expensive
to develop specialist techniques for data look up because the generic look up
techniques provided by conventional cpus were improving so rapidly. Now that
mooresLaw has run its course there is opening for such specialist solutions.

<h2 id="ca">Competitive Advantage</h2>

<p>The very real possibility of saving real money in real cloudComputing
centers by reducing the electricity needed to perform a database look up.</p>

<h2 id="ip">Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>Masks for ascis implementing doc.

<h2 id="gtms">Go to Market (Marketing & Sales) Strategy</h2>

<p>Send a fax to each of the major cloudComputing data center operators -
Amazon, Microsoft etc. explaining the benefits with a sample chip mounted on a
pcb for them to test by plugging it into an ethernet router.

<p>Copies to Oracle to keep them appraised of the situation.

<h2 id="fd">Feasibility Demonstration</h2>

<p>Plug a circuit board with such a chip mounted on it into an ethernet router
and show that it quickly starts to answer queries quickly.</p>

<h2 id="kftacmd">Key Future Technical and Customer Milestones & Deliverables</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Mask
<li><p>Demo chip for marketing purposes
<li><p>Savings report from one customer keen to advertise their green credentials
<li><p>Sustained production at tmsc to meet follow on demand
</ol>

<h2 id="cadp">Current & Desired Partnerships</h2>

<p>None current. Desired: Organization that can provide expertise in converting
a software design into a hardware design.

<h2 id="waybpc">What are your biggest challenges?</h2>

<p>We have a software design written as an emulation of basic logic gates that
implements a database look up. We need help converting this into a chip mask.

<p>For instance, here is the gate level of a chip that does fast database look ups:
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philiprbrenan/SiliconChipBtree/28313140095459558e8b1e00f126656c90511a58/lib/Silicon/Chip/svg/tree.svg">

<p>And this is the first level of wiring:
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philiprbrenan/SiliconChipBtree/28313140095459558e8b1e00f126656c90511a58/lib/Silicon/Chip/svg/tree_1.svg">


<h2 id="waygpr">What are your greatest perceived risks?</h2>

<p>That some well funded company will seize on this idea before we have made
any progress at the hardware level and get their first.</p>

<h2 id="wdyefc">What do you expect from the ChipStart UK programme?</h2>

<p>Expertise in the basics of chip design to help us produce a working chip
plus all the usual stuff that goes with that: tools, personnel skilled in using
these tools, the means to pay these people, financial/funding advice etc.

<h2 id="ire12">Income or Revenue Expected in 12 & 24 Months</h2>
<p>Unknown

<h2 id="ccb">Current Cash Balance & Monthly Cash Burn Rate</h2>
<p>Unknown

<h2 id="afn12">Amount of Funding Needed in 12 & 24 Months</h2>
<p>Unknown.

<h2 id="pfcr">Previous Funding & Capital Raised, & From Whom</h2>
<p>None

<h2 id="peemc">Primary Expected Expenses by Major Category</h2>
<p>Unknown.

<p>We probably do not need office space as this work can be done any where in
the world including, for the most part, from home offices as long as they as
equipped with a usable work station and high speed internet access.

<h2 id="eslai">Exit Strategy (Licensing, Acquisition, IPO)</h2>

<p>Oracle will want to buy this intellectual property  just like they bought
MySQL as long as it works, because doing so would give them a jump start on the
technology while deny that capabilities to their competitors. </p>
