<p>The world is warming.  The Guardian reports that we are likely to pass 1.5C
with in three years.

<p>The Wall Street Journal reports that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers consume 100 times more
power than a typical industrial business.  According to the International
Energy Agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers consume about 100 billion kilowatt hours per year,
equivalent to the entire usage of a medium sized country like Spain, Mexico, or
Britain.

<p><q>"The most effective way to save energy is to stop wasting it."</q> - David Suzuki

<p>Data centers spend a lot of time doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look ups using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>
running on generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>s.

<p>We can significantly reduce the amount of energy by using specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s
that implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> currently used to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look ups as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">hardware</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>. We are following the approach outlined in <a href="Introduction to VLSI systems">Introduction to VLSI, Mead, Conway, 1980</a> by
designing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> instructions optimized for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look ups.

<p>Graphics processing units have kead the way. They are present in every smart
phone these days because they burn one thousand times less power than does the
equivalent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> implemented on a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU</a> while running one thousand
times faster. We can do the same with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look ups.

<p>Burning less power to do each look up means burning less electricity which
means lower electricity bills for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers and less carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere from burning fossil fuels to generate electricity while their
customers spend less time waiting for the results of the look ups. Everybody
wins.</p>

<p>Currently we have succeeded in representing the Btree look up algorithm as
an instruction sequence implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate">Nand</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate">digital logic gate</a>s.

<p>We need your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help">help</a> to place this wiring diagram on a real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>
alongside a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a> controller so that we can drive these
specialized instructions to see if they lead to the expected improvements.

<p>Then we can:

<ol>
<li><p>Send the working <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> to well known the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers for evaluation
<li><p>Report the real savings from one customer to drive further sales
<li><p>Satisfy the demand by having the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> built at scale at the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_fabrication_plant">fab</a>s in Arizona.
<li><p>Make lots of money while saving the environment!
