<h1>Script describing Database on a Chip</h1>

<p>The world is warming.  The Guardian reports that we are likely to pass 1.5C
in three years from now.

<p>The Wall Street Journal reports that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers consume 100 times more
power than a typical industrial business.  According to the International
Energy Agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers consume about 100 billion kilowatt hours per year,
equivalent to the entire usage of a medium sized country like Spain, Mexico, or
Britain.

<p>Data centers spend a lot of time doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look ups using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>
running on generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>s.

<p>We can significantly reduce the amount of energy used to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look
ups by using specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>s that implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> currently used to
perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look ups.

<p>Graphics processing units are present in every smart phone these days
because they burn one thousand times less power than does the equivalent
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> implemented on a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU</a> while running one thousand times faster.

<p>Burning less power to do each look up means burning less electricity which
means lower electricity bills for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers and less carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere from burning fossil fuels to generate electricity.</p>

<p>We are following the approach outlined in <a href="Introduction to VLSI systems">Introduction to VLSI, Mead, Conway, 1980</a> by designing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> instructions
optimized for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> look ups.

<p>Currently we have succeeded in representing the Btree look up algorithm as
an instruction implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate">Nand</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate">digital logic gate</a>s.

<p>We need your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help">help</a> to place this wiring diagram on a real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon">Silicon</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a>
alongside a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a> controller so that we can drive these
specialized instructions to see if they lead to the expected improvements.

<p>Then we can:

<ol>
<li><p>Send the working <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> to well known the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> centers for evaluation
<li><p>Report the savings report from one customer keen to persuade ithers that they must follow
<li><p>Satisfy the demand by having the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> built at scale at a fab in Arizona.
<li><p>make lots of money while saving the environment!
</ol>
