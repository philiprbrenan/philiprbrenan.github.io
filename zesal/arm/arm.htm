<h1 id="es">Executive Summary</h1>

<p>Hi every-one, my name is Vanina .  I work on product development at
Appa Apps where we are designing "Database on a chip": High speed, low power
database look-ups to reduce dataCenter electricity bills for real money cost
savings.

<p>Why do we want to do this?

<p>The world is warming.  guardian reports that we are likely to  <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/08/world-scientists-climate-failure-survey-global-temperature?source=email&utm=">pass
<b>1.5</b> degrees centigrade within the next three years</a>.

<p>wsj reports that dataCenters consume one hundred times more power than that
of a typical industrial business.

<p>According to the International Energy Agency: dataCenters, globally, consume
as much energy as the entire electricity usage of medium-sized countries like
Spain, Mexico, Argentina, or Britain.

<p>davidSuzuki tells us that: <q>The most effective way to save energy is to
stop wasting it</q>.

<p>dataCenters waste a lot of time and energy doing database look-ups using
software running on generic cpus.

<p>We believe we can significantly reduce the amount of energy used to do
database look-ups by replacing the software, currently used to do them, with
specialized chips designed to implement the same btree algorithm more
efficiently in hardware instead. We are following the approach outlined in VLSI
by designing cpu instructions optimized for database look-ups.

<p>Graphics processing units show us the way: they are present in every
smartphone today because they burn one thousand times less power than the
equivalent software running on a generic cpu while running one thousand times
faster. We can do the same with database look-ups.

<p>Burning less power to do each look-up means: using less electricity; which
means: lower electricity bills for dataCenter operators; and: less
carbonDioxide in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels to generate that
electricity; so: we can all breathe free; while dataCenter customers waste less
time waiting for their look-ups. Everybody wins!</p>

<p>Currently we have succeeded in representing the well known btree look-up
algorithm as an instruction implemented in nand gates ready for placement on a
chip as shown in this diagram:

<img id="wiring" src="http://prb.appaapps.com/zesal/pitchdeck/images/BTreeJ.png">

<p>We need your help to place this instruction on a real silicon chip alongside
a generic cpu and an ethernet controller so that we can drive this specialized
instruction, in real life, to see if it leads to the improvements we expect.

<p>Then we can:

<ul>
<li><p><i>Firstly</i>:  Send working chips to all the well known dataCenter operators for evaluation
<li><p><i>Secondly</i>: Report the real savings from one operator to drive further chip sales at the others
<li><p><i>Thirdly</i>:  Satisfy that demand by having chips built at scale at the new fabs being constructed in Arizona.
<li><p><i>Lastly</i>:   Make lots of money while saving the environment!
</ul>

<p>Un pequeÃ±o paso para el hombre, un gran salto para la humanidad!</p>

<h1 id="ps">Problem Statement</h1>

<p> dataCenters consume 100 times more power than a typical industrial
business. Wall Street Journal 2024-03-29 A14

<p>Electricity demand to power dataCenters is projected to increase by 13% to
15% compounded annually through 2030. Yet a shortage of power is already
delaying new dataCenters by two to six years, according to commercial- real
estate firm CBRE Group. It is also driving Big Tech companies into the energy
business. Amazon this month struck a $650 million deal to buy a dataCenter in
Pennsylvania powered by an on-site 2.5 gigawatt nuclear plant. Wall Street
Journal 2024-03-29 A14

<h1 id="sabm">Service and Business Model</h1>

<p>High speed, low power database system on a chip reduces power consumption
for dataCenters leading to reduced electricity bills which saves real money
making for an easy sale of the chips that make these saving possible.

<p>A gpu saves power by performing graphics calculations in hardware rather
than in software. Likewise Bitcoin saves power by performing hash calculations
in hardware rather then software.</p>

<p>nvidia has become a trillion dollar company by providing the masks for gpu
chips that perform graphics functions via custom silicon.  This process of
customizing chips to specific tasks was predicted in VLSI .

<p>Eventually this process will be extended to database look ups as these too
consume significant amounts of time and power in dataCenter.  Not only does
the lookup burn energy on the database server, but also on the computers
waiting for responses from the database.</p>

<p>All the major database systems are open source.  By making sample chips
available with these capabilities to open source developers we can reasonable
expect them to take advantage of these capabilities just as, for example,  gcc
takes advantage of vector instructions to implement the <b>strlen</b> function
whenever possible.

<p>The availability of databases capable of exploiting such capabilities will
lead to more demand for more access to such chips which dataCenter operators
will be keen to provide as they will be able to save money on their electricity
bills while making their offering more compelling than those who fail to offer
such a service.  An analogous process has already led to the replacement of
mechanical disk drives with ssd in dataCenters for similar reasons. </p>

<h1 id="sg">Sales & Growth</h1>
<p>None so far.

<h1 id="sr">Service revenue</h1>
<p>None so far.

<h1 id="htc">Traction with customers/investors</h1>
<p>None so far.

<h1 id="soc">Size of client base</h1>
<p>None so far.

<h1 id="mp">Market Potential</h1>

<p>According to the IEA world production of electricity is: 10 trillion
kilowatt hours per year. dataCenters use about 1% of that electricity. Say we
could reduce dataCenter electricity usage by 1% that would save 1 billion
kilowatt hours annually. A kilowatt hour costs approximately 10 cents. This
would yield gross savings of $100 million per year.

<h1 id="tmdac">Target market</h1>

<h2 id="tmd">Description</h2>

<p> dataCenter operators who wish to reduce their electricity bills.

<h2 id="kca">Key competitive advantages</h2>

<p>System on a chip specialized to do database look-ups more quickly while
using less power than a generic cpu leading to quantifiable savings on
electricity bills.

<h1 id=cl">Competitive Landscape</h1>

<h2 id="fpgas">Field Programmable Gate Arrays</h2>

<p>An fpga could also be programmed to do fast database look ups using the
btree algorithm.  However, fpga devices use 10-100 times as much power as a
custom chip and are perhaps 10-100 times lower.  For database look ups, an fpga
does not save enough electricity or time to make it a viable solution.</p>

<h2 id="simd">Single Instruction, Multiple Data</h2>

<p>simd vector instruction sets are common these days.  We emulated the x64
instruction set using nasmx86 to see if simd instructions produced any useful
gain in the implementation of the btree algorithm. On the contrary, we found
that using simd  instruction produced a slower implementation because more time
was spent assembling the data in the formats required by these instructions
than was gained by using them.

<h2 id="cuco">Custom Computers</h2>

<p>Both <b>Oracle</b> and ibm have custom computer products that indicate that
they have given thought to this problem.

<p><b>DB2</b> <a
href="https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/technotes/tips1204.pdf">with BLU
Acceleration</a> runs on existing ibm infrastructure.  It is a software
solution not a chip level hardware solution.

<p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/"><b>Oracle
Exadata</b></a> is a conventional computer optimized with appropriate memory,
diskdrives and network options to provide an optimal conventional computing
environment in which to run an Oracle database.  But there is no evidence of
any new chip design being used to power this solution.

<p>Both of these important database vendors are aware that acceleration is
beneficial to database processing but they have not moved beyond the
constraints of conventional solutions. Given that both companies operate in
mature markets,  a break through on this area would surely have to be of great
interest to them.</p>

<h1 id="sa1">Solution</h1>
<h2 id="sa2">Solution Outline</h2>

<p>One of the more common actions performed by computers in dataCenters is
running software to look up data in a database or in memory data structures.

<p>Convention cpus have vector instruction sets specialized for doing
arithmetic but do not have instructions specialized for traversing database
structures held in memory. Consequently such looks ups consume much more
time and electricity than is strictly necessary.

<p>Converting software to hardware can speed up processing by a factor of one
thousand while similarly reducing power requirements. This has already been
demonstrated by the rapid adoption of gpus for smart phone graphics processing
and the asics used for crypto currency mining.</p>

<p>Following the approach outlined in VLSI we are designing instructions
optimized for database look ups.  These instructions will then be executed by a
small cpu against a database held in ssd memory to obtain nano second look ups
while using less power than conventional cpus.  Much less time times much less
power is much less energy.

<p>Communication with the outside world will be via on chip, high speed
ethernet controllers.

<h2 id="sa3">End application</h2>

<p>All database systems in dataCenters are addressed via ip addresses.  It
will be easy to plug the chip into an ethernet controller to act as a front end
cache for such systems to perform high speed, low power look ups.

<h2 id="sa4">Technology</h2>

<p>The well known process of converting software to hardware as described
in VLSI .</p>


<h1 id="hla">High-level solution architecture</h1>

<p>All digital computing can be reduced to a sequence of operations implemented
by nand gates. A conventional, generic cpu most manufacture this sequence on
the fly as needed as one sequence among many.  doc would avoid
all this overhead by hard coding the well known btree algorithm used in most
database look ups as a sequence of gates on a silicon chip implementing the most
intensive part of the btree look up algorithm directly in the fabric of the
chip in the most efficient manner possible.

<p>These instruction sequences would be placed either on their own chip and
connected via ethernet or included as part of existing system on a chip such as
<a

Snapdragon X Elite</a>.

<h1 id="usp">Solution Unique Selling Point</h1>

<p>Plug the chip into an ethernet router and watch it do database look ups
faster while using less electricity than your current equipment can.  Less
power consumption means more profits.</p>

<h1 id="sdrm1">Solution development</h1>

<h2 id="sdrm2">Roadmap</h2>

<p>Currently we have succeeded in representing the btree look up algorithm as
an instruction implemented in nand gates.

<p>We used a purpose built eda tool: <b>SiliconChip </b> to design, simulate,
and layout the required sequences of gates.  This solution needs to be cross
checked with industry standard tools to confirm expected operation.

<p>Then we need to place this sequence on a real chip alongside a generic cpu
and ethernet controller so that we can drive these specialized instructions to
see if they lead to the expected improvements.

<h2 id="kc">Key challenge</h2>

<p>Getting our proposed wiring diagram implemented as a functioning chip.

<img id="wiring" src="http://prb.appaapps.com/zesal/pitchdeck/images/BTreeJ.png">

<h1 id="daip">Arm IP</h1>

<p>The additional instructions implemented by database on a chip could usefully
be driven by a conventional low power generic cpu either directly on the same
chip or connected to such cpus on other chips via an ethernet controller.

<h1 id="sbg">Strategy/Business Growth Roadmap</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Construct proposed chip mask in software and test through emulation.
<li><p>Use the mask to create a demo chip in hardware and mount on a pcb.
<li><p>Send the pcb to well known dataCenter operators for evaluation.
<li><p>Report the actual savings from one customer to persuade more customers that they must follow.
<li><p>Sustained production at the new fabs in az to supply follow on demand.
</ol>

<h1 id="aaa">Environmental impact</h1>

<p>One small step towards saving our environment by reducing demand for
electricity. One giant improvement for mankind.
