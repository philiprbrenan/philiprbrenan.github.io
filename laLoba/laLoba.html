<h1>Project La Loba: Lights Out Book Automation</h1>

<p>Here is a design for a fully automated system for reliably and cost
effectively receiving, picking, listing, purging and mailing several thousand
books per day chosen from a body of one million books or more. The proposed
system is built from cheap and readily available components made of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a>. 
<p>The proposed system does not rely on humans to work within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)">process</a>, merely to observe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)">process</a> from a safe distance and to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)">process</a> equipment in good working order.  Some minimal human effort is required to tip
Gaylords full of books into the system and, likewise, transport away Gaylords
of books to be recycled or mailed.

<h1>Guiding principles</h1>

<ol>

<li>Full automation keeping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person">people</a> safe by keeping them out of the machinery
when it is operating

<li>Avoid rotations where ever possible as they are harder to implement than
linear motion.

<li>Only use cheap, recyclable components available via mass production.  This
implies the extensive use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a>. 
<li>Steel can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)">process</a> 10 times its own weight.  A hundred tons of books will
require 10 tons of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)">process</a> them.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> currently costs around $1K per
ton.

<li>Favor simplicity, reliability, robust, linear, quick payback solutions over
all others.

<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don't Repeat Yourself</a>: favor a gantry crane with 4 wheels over 100 bookcases each with 4
wheels.

</ol>

<h1>Floor Plan</h1>

<p>Books are tipped out onto a downward sloping ramp.  The ramp is vibrated
to spread out the books along the ramp.

<figure>
  <img src="images/FullAutomationFloorPlan.jpeg">
  <figcaption>Floor plan</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Books are picked out of the ramp using a vacuum powered corner grabber.
Books that are <b>buys</b> are jacketted in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> clip. The remainder are
transferred to recycling bins. Jacketed buys are moved to the kitting area for
loading into storage trays via the lower crane.  The storage trays full of
books are transported to the dense cube in the storage area by the upper crane.

<p>The storage area  is processed periodically in a <b>pick cycle</b>. In a
pick cycle, each tray in turn is moved to the kitting area and its contents
transferred either to the kitting area or to another tray. The tray is then
returned to the storage area by the upper crane.

<p>Here is a movie <a href="https://github.com/philiprbrenan/philiprbrenan.github.io/blob/main/laLoba/movies/stackOverFlow.webm?raw=true">
showing a simulation of the storage area during processing.</a></p>


<p>The kitting area is used to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler">assemble</a> <b>multi-order</b> orders during each
pick cycle. As soon as a multi-order is complete it is moved by the lower crane
to the mail area where the books are placed in packages and dropped in to a
mail bin ready for daily pickup.


<h1>Design</h1>

<p>Books can be simultaneously protected from wear and tear, made to occupy a
standardized volume, kept from opening unexpectedly and made manipulable by
jacketing them in a magnetic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> clip.

<figure>
  <img src="images/bookClip2.png">
  <figcaption>Book clip made with three <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">spot</a> welds and four bends</figcaption>

<p>Three dimensional drawing: <a

Clip</a>.

<p>It is conceivable that book clips can be fabricated as a <a
href="https://jymachinery.en.made-in-china.com/product/vSRnOTpkbjYL/China-Precision-Customized-Part-Stainless-Steel-Investment-Lost-Wax-Silicon-Sol-Casting-Combine-with-CNC-Machining-Service-Full-inspection-and-Great-Aftersale-Service.html">single
metal casting</a> or using <a
href="https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/custom-manufacturing-fabricating/disadvantages-and-advantages-of-plastic-over-metal-fabrication/">injection
molded plastic</a> with enough iron powder in it to make it magnetic.</p>

<p>The jacket illustrated is designed to be easy to clip around books of
differing sizes and, likewise, to be removed when the book is mailed or purged.
The pyramid at the bottom is used to guide the clip, and hence the book, into a
corresponding pyramid slot in the kitting area and storage trays reducing the need for
positional accuracy considerably. The oval clips are made of spring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> which
is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">spot</a> welded to the U-tube frame as is the pyramid at the bottom.

<p>Shapes such as <a
href="https://jymachinery.en.made-in-china.com/product/twCTudzOrgUM/China-OEM-Metal-Stainless-Steel-Precision-Investment-Silica-Sol-Lost-Wax-Casting-for-Auto-Parts-Machinery-Industrial-Valve-Pump-Impeller-Marine-Kitchenware-Bathroom.html">pyramids
are easily made by casting.</a></p>

<p>The book clip shown has the following advantages of:

<ol>
<li>It fits a <b>range</b> of different book sizes
<li>It can be <b>reused</b> multiple times
<li>It is <b>easy</b> to place and remove around books
<li>It is <b>easy</b> to manufacturer in a small number of <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/errata02/os/complete/part3-all-inclusive/contentmodels/cmlts.html#cmlts__step">step</a>s </ol>

<p>It is easy to stand books in an egg tray even though egg trays were not
designed for this purpose:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/booksOnEggTray.jpg">
  <figcaption>Books in an egg tray</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Consequently it will be easy to stand books wrapped with such a clip in a
tray with appropriate sized slots in its floor. Lowering the book into position
with a magnetic or pneumatic grab will engage the pyramid in the corresponding
pyramid slot to position the clip, and hence the book, accurately.  The grab
can then be withdrawn leaving the book standing in position.

<p>The books are stored in a tray acting as a large egg tray:

<figure>
  <img src="images/Tray3d.png">
  <figcaption>Books in a tray</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The outer tray is typically <b>5.8m</b> by <b>2.3m</b> and consists of five
smaller inner trays bolted to the outer frame. This arrangement allows the
inner trays to be removed from the outer tray and reassembled as cubes for
easier transportation.

<p>The dimensions of the tray correspond to those of a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container">Intermodal Shipping Container</a> which enables
us to use equipment developed for such containers to lift and transport them:

<figure>
  <img src="images/Corner.png">
  <figcaption>Intermodal shipping container corner</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is a significant advantage to using container technology: the spreader
bar tensions the sides of the tray when the tray is lifted allowing the sides
of the tray to be constructed of less <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> than might otherwise be required.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/SpreaderBar.png">
  <figcaption>Intermodal shipping container spreader bar</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The books are placed in the tray using a three axis crane with an electro-magnetic chuck:

<figure>
  <img src="svg/OffsetCassette.svg">
  <figcaption>Placing books in a tray</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The trays can be stacked in a storage area and then brought to a work area
for processing using a gantry crane.

<figure>
  <img src="svg/FlatSteelJacketDuplex.svg">
  <figcaption>Processing books in the work area</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the work area books are picked and placed in the AutoKitter which has
enough room to hold the number of books picked in one cycle.  For each cycle,
the AutoKitter is preloaded with replacement books to go into the slots vacated
by picked books.  At the end of the cycle the three axis crane unloads the
AutoKitter in multi-order order and places the books in the mail area where
they are removed from their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> clips and dropped into mailing sacks.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> clips are sent back to receiving for reuse on incoming books.

<figure>
  <img src="svg/AutoKitter.svg">
  <figcaption>Auto kitting books in the work area</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the receiving area books are tipped out of gaylords onto a descending
ramp. Foam covered weighted rollers hung above the ramp <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help">help</a> flatten out the
books.  The books slide slowly down the ramp because the ramp is vibrated by a
hydraulically powered plate vibrator which shifts the books into the positions
which minimizes their potential energy by increasing their entropy.

<figure>
  <img src="svg/TippingOut.svg">
  <figcaption>Tipping books out from incoming Gaylords</figcaption>

<p>Once the books are sufficiently spread out it is easy to isolate the corners
either by using a 3d camera ($279 from Intel) or manually using offshore labor
with access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet">gigabit</a> Internet.

<p>Here is a movie <a href="https://github.com/philiprbrenan/philiprbrenan.github.io/blob/main/laLoba/movies/CornerGrabber.mp4?raw=true">
of the corner grabber being printed</a>

<p>Applying a corner grabber with a vacuum to a corner of a book that forms part of the
spine of the book enables the book to be lifted off the ramp onto a tray in a
known orientation.

<p>A domestic vacuum cleaner id more than capable of lifting a book by a corner of the spine as long as it is placed accurately:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/VacuumedBook.jpg">
  <figcaption>Using a vacuum cleaner to lift a book</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We do not need to lift the book clear of the deck, we just need to lift it
enough so that it can slide easily over other books while it is moved to the
clipping station and placed there in a known orientation as show in this <a
href="https://github.com/philiprbrenan/philiprbrenan.github.io/blob/main/laLoba/movies/cornerGrabber.webm?raw=true">movie</a>

<p>At this point the book can be examined, cleaned, checked etc. then
maneuvered into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> clip.

<p>Once in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> clip the book is easy to manipulate using an electromagnet
if it is a "buy" else dropped in the recycling bin. "Buys" are placed in the
kitting area so that they can be used to replace books picked for mailing. Once
a jacketed book has been placed in a tray the book can be safely stored in the
storage area from whence it can be picked out as needed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future">future</a>. 
<h1>Key concepts</h1>

<p>Here are the key ideas that this design relies on:

<h2>Steel clip</h2>

<p>There is a strong case to be made for putting the book into some kind of
jacket, namely: mechanical manipulators are not as sensitive as human hands and
so are likely to subject the book to greater forces when manipulating the book
leading to the possibility of damage.

<p>Placing the book in a jacket has the benefit that the book cannot fly open
when being manipulated or transferred. While it is easy for a human to see and
rectify this condition it is much harder for a machine to do this. But even
though a human can rectofy this situation, it is still a waste of valauble time
for them to engage in this pointless activity.

<p>A number of different jacketting systems were considered:
<ol>

<li>The jacket is an individual <b>cubby slot</b> in a bookcase for each book.
Attractive because of its simplicity, to be set against the difficulty of
maneuvering an unprotected book into a cubby slot, an action that might have to
be performed several times to each books.  A secondary difficulty is the amount
of material and time required to construct one million such cubby slots.

<li>The jacket is formed by <b>shrink wrapping</b> the book. Attractive because
shrink wrap automation is a well known and supported technique.  The major
difficulty is disposing of the shrink wrap when the book is purged - getting
the book out of a wrapping that was designed to stay on is challenging
especially if it has to be done in a completely automated manner, yet must be
done because the book cannot be recycled if it is shrink wrapped.  A secondary
concern is the difficulty of applying an identifying label to a shrink wrapped
book.

<li>The jacket is formed from <b>cardboard</b>: such a jacket can be recycled as is,
but cannot easily be reused meaning that the cost of a new jacket must be
bourne by each book regardless of whether the books sells.  A secondary
disadvantage is finding a reliable way to close the cardboard sleeve around the
book that can be easily undone when it is necessary to remove the book from its
jacket.

<li>The jacket is formed from <b>plastic</b>: such a jacket can be reused but not
recycled.  In the case of DVDs the DVD is already pre-wrapped in a plastic
jacket and this should be exploited in the storage system.  For books there is
the difficulty of getting the book in and out of the jacket, the amount of
plastic required, and the difficulty of lifting an object enclosed in slippery
plastic jacket.  Plastic is not recyclable creating a waste disposal problem.

<li>The jacket is formed from a clip consisting of a pair of <b>steel ovals</b>
that grip the book rather like a clothes pin. Steel has the unbeatable
advantages of high strength, low cost, malleability and recyclability combined
with magnetic properties that make a book enclosed in iron easy to manipulate
with machinery equipped with electro-magnets as is convincingly demonstrated by
any toaster. </ol>

  <figcaption>Book clip made with three <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">spot</a> welds and four bends</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Three dimensional drawing: <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fMAdkoX7Pky?sharecode=6vmsbOA7_1qqPTeM7qDw8GjgGHHD45ZJo9zMHu8y_n4">Book Clip</a>.


<p>At the moment using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> jacket appears to offer the best combination of
cost and reliability and so is the solution being most actively
investigated.</p>

<h2>Offset stacking</h2>

<p>Humans are capable of removing books placed in a book case albeit at the
risk of damaged fingers and skin, bumped heads, bashed knees and wasted space.
Trying to get a machine to replicate this coordination of vision and mechanical
actions is difficult.

<p>Instead it is proposed to stand books in staggered lines with the books so
arranged that there is air space around the outside of the clip around the
book that can be entered by a mechanical picker with merely centimeter
positional accuracy at a slight loss of packing density.

<h2>Horizontal book cases</h2>

<p>Vertical book cases are hardly satisfactory for humans as they must reach up
and down at awkward heights to get books from the bottom or the top.  But for
humans, horizontal book cases are not viable due to a lack of the <a
href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh_(1961)/Chapter_9">necessary
dorsal muscles.</a>.

<p>From an automation point of view: vertical book cases require 5 times as
much construction material to give them the same moment of inertial as a
horizontal book case being tensioned with a spreader bar and are all too likely
to drop books when in motion.  Picking from and listing to a vertical book case
is difficult because gravity frustrates rather than assists these actions.</p>

<p>Horizontal book cases are easy to transport, occupy little head room when
being transported and can be constructed from 5 times less material than
vertical book cases because they can be pretensioned using a spreader bar.
Automated picking and listing is assisted by gravity which is now aligned with
the direction of motion used in these actions rather transverse to it.

<h2>Pneumatic corner grabbing</h2>

<p>Vacuum assisted corner grabbing makes it possible to pick up individual
books dumped out en-masse from a Gaylord when the books are lying at random
angles as we can always be certain that at least one corner will be uppermost
and thus available for grabbing.

<p>A plausible <a
href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jNoJs2dFSA3?sharecode=MM_Se39T-FlG2Fj0ULUAEVU0eYCAx_Qw--_-INOPigU">corner
grabber</a> has been designed in three dimensions and sent for three
dimensional printing to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing">test</a> this idea in more detail.

<p>Here is a <a href="movies/CornerGrabber.mp4">movie
of the corner grabber being printed</a>

<h2>Sorting books by size</h2>

<p>Sorting books by size allows similar size books to be stored close together
in a structure designed for books of that size to enable greater packing
density than would be possible if the structure had to accommodate books of any
size. Fortunately most books are sized using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">The Golden Section</a> and cluster
around a small number of average sizes.  It is entirely possible that the
existing manual system will have to be retained for books with extremal
dimensions.

<p>Fortunately sorting books by size is not difficult using a corner grabber
and a <a href="https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d415/">three dimensional camera</a>. 
<h1>Advantages</h1>

<p>This design has numerous advantages:</p>

<ol>

<li><b>Space</b> - the system can be scaled in three dimensions to make good
use of floor space by occupying currently unoccupied head room.</li>

<li><b>Speed</b> - the system can easily be made faster by adding more cranes,
trays and workstations.

<li><b>Density</b> - storage is used efficiently by stacking the books densely.

<li><b>Alignment</b> - only centimeter accuracy is required in placing books
and trays - much less than is easily available from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser">laser</a> distance measurements
and worm screw drives.

<li><b>Reliability</b> - the system has few moving parts all of which are
manufactured and in use world wide making the system easy to maintain.

<li><b>Robustness</b> - the system is built of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> and can withstand bumps
and the other minor shocks the flesh is heir to without great difficulty.

<li><b>Price</b> - the system can be built from a small number of standard
standard components that can easily be sourced from competing manufacturers from <a href="https://www.made-in-china.com/">Made In China</a>. 
</ol>


<h1>Cost</h1>

<p>The cost of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> used to operate on 100 tons of books can be estimated
heuristically at 10% or 10 tons.  Bulk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> products cost around $1K per ton
or $1 per kilogram. Finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> products such as book clips cost $10 per
kilogram.

<p>The major cost of this project is located in the labor required to design
it.  We can either hire an expensive engineer to produce the system once using
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall development methodology</a> as if we were programming in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> <b>or</b> we can use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile development methodology</a> as
we do with <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> by applying low cost labor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> to implement a number of
prototypes that can be iterated quickly and cheaply to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_(Unix)">find</a> the optimal design.

<p>A design considered optimal can then be outsourced for construction in bulk
to either <a
href="https://tijuanaedc.org/contract-manufacturing-in-mexico/">Mexico</a> or <a href="https://www.made-in-china.com/">Made In China</a>, the latter in particular having shown great interest in securing this
kind of work.

<h1>Recommendation</h1>

<p>We can build this system incrementally using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile development methodology</a>. 
<p>The smallest component we could build first is the corner grabber
illustrated above.

<p>The next smallest component would be the steel jacket used to protect
each book.

<p>From there we can progress to a minimal kitting crane followed by a full
size one.

<p>Once relationships with suppliers have been established and some capability
jdeveloped in basic steel work we can contemplate larger components that will
allow us to gradually replace the existing manual wooden system with an
automated steel one.




<h1>Specifics</h1>

<h2>Placing a clip on a book</h2>

<p>The clips used to protect and manipulate book are made from spring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> welded to a U channel.  The clip can easily be placed using the device pictured
below:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/ClippingStationA.png">
  <img src="images/ClippingStationB.png">
  <figcaption>Placing a clip on a book</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Clips, recovered from the mailing and purging areas slide along a plastic
monorail to the clipping station.  The clip at the bitter end is positioned by
the blue electromagnet. A book is dragged into the clipping station by a corner
grabber suspended from an overhead two girder gantry crane. Once in the
clipping station the book is positioned by pneumatic rams and its cover is held
down in place to prevent buckling when the clip is applied.  A pneumatic ram
pushes the next clip onto the book rather in the same way that a staple gun
pushes a staple into paper. The book is thus clipped by the face opposing the
spine making it easy to pick the book up by its spine using a side grabber
which rotates the book into the preferred vertical position used for storage
and kitting.</p>

<p>Experiments using curved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> kitchen utensils (forks) show that curved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> slides easily over a typical book cover. </p>

<h2>Removing a clip from a book</h2>

<p>Books that are mailed or purged will have to be declipped. The blue
electro-magnet holds the clip in place while the books is moved by a grab and
placed in a mailing sack. The electromagnet holding the clip is then rotated
and the electromagnet released so that the clip falls out onto the grey
monorail below which will transport the clip back to the clipping station.

<h2>Moving clips back from the mailing area to the jacketting area</h2>

<p>The clips recovered from books that have been mailed or purged are returned
to the jacketting area by sliding them along a <a

<h2>Placing a book in the kitting area or a storage tray</h2>

<p>Books are pulled out of or placed into the kitting area or storage trays using the <b>Book Puller</b>.

<figure>
  <img src="images/BookPullerA.png">

<p>The book puller is positioned by a scissor jack driven by a worm screw.  The
design of the clip attached to the book requires only centimeter accuracy to
position a book in the kitting area or storage trays, yet a worm screw
(unleveraged) can provide 500 times that accuracy at 20cm/s.  We do need to
position over distances of several meters which would be difficult to do with
an unleveraged workscrew but is feasible with a 10 level scissor gate driven by
such a worm screw.

<p>The book is lowered (or raised) using two pneumatic pistons. The pistons
grip the book along its spine using a vacuum powered spine grabber.  Once the
book has been lifted into the book puller a small gate driven by a stepper
motor closes over the slot through which the book entered the puller to prevent
the book from falling out in the event that vacuum is lost during transit.

<figure>
  <img src="images/SpineGrabberA.png">
  <img src="images/SpineGrabberB.png">
  <figcaption>A grabber for picking up books by their spines</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Storing books spine up allows a bar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">code</a> on the spine of the book to be read
to confirm the identity of the book stored at that location.

<p>The book puller is mounted on trolleys which run along ibeam(s) scaffolded
over the kitting  and jacketting areas. The book puller can be positioned in
two dimensions using two scissor gates - although only one has been shown in
the drawing for the purposes of clarity.

<h3>Positioning a book puller over a book in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket</a> in a storage tray</h3>

<p>The actual position of the book puller will be measured by a <a

range finder</a> which is accurate to about 3mm: more than enough accuracy to
position the 1cm pyramid at the base of the book clip in the corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket</a> in the tray below.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser">laser</a> range finder coordinates for each slot in each tray can be found
by shining a strong light under the tray in an otherwise dark room - it will
then be easy to center the book puller above each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket</a> in each tray using a
light meter and record the coordinates accurately so that the location of each
slot can be located subsequently by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser">laser</a> range finder alone without having to
locate each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket</a> a new which will save time placing and retrieving books.

<p>The coefficient of thermal expansion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> is 11e-6 per degree centigrade
leading to a change in size of a 10m <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> beam experiencing a temperature
change of 20C will give rise to a thermal expansion of 2mm which is well within
the desired accuracy of 1 cm for positioning books.

<h3>Books positioned in a tray</h3>

<p>Trays holding books are made of square <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> tubing with pyramid slots
(yellow) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">spot</a> welded to their sides. The pyramid on each book clip fits
securely into a pyramid slot. The shape of the pyramid allows the clip to be
placed reliably with just centimeter accuracy.

<p>The pyramid and the corresponding slot is easy to make by mould casting at
$10 per kilogram in bulk. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> tubes to which the pyramid slots are welded
area cost $1K per ton in bulk.

<p>The positioning of the pyramid slots on the square <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel">steel</a> tubes only needs to
be done with millimeter accuracy or so as we can measure their positions photo
electronically then record their actual coordinates for later use.

<h3>Book Hill Climb</h3>

<p>One proposed solution for separating books dumped out of a Gaylord is to
place them on an upward sloping conveyor belt covered with grippy plastic.  As
the books go up hill any upper books not in direct contact with the conveyor
belt slide off any lower books until they settle directly onto the conveyor.

<p>Books coming off the hill climb will need to be oriented in a known way
which might require corner grabbing to ensure that the book is correctly
positioned in the clipping station. Once corner grabbing is in play we can
probably dispense with the hill climb as the separation of books can also be
done by corner grabbing once they have been spread out by vibrating them down a
ramp which will also be necessary with a hill climb because otherwise the books
at the bottom of the dump out pile might get damahed betwen the force applied
by the weight of the books above them and the action of the conveyor belt.

<p>There is also the question of whether the grippy plastic can stay grippy
enough to be useful after having several tons of books dumped onto it.</p>

<h2>Sorting books</h2>

<p>Books are poured out of a Gaylord into the large end of  a sloping semi-cone
which is rocked (and possibly vibrated) so that the books gradually separate
into a line of books aligned with their longest axis parallel to that of the
semi-cone.  The semi-cone is perhaps 5 meters long  and 2 meters wide at the
wide, high end before narrowing down to perhaps 40 cm at the low, narrow end.

<p>The length and motion of the semi-cone provide space and time for books to
spread out enough that they can be dropped one by one on to the conveyor belt
beneath the narrow low end of the semi-cone.

<p>At the low end of the semi-cone the books drop out onto a conveyor belt in
front of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array">array</a> of sized pushers.  We can measure the size of each book on the
conveyor belt using a bright light placed under the conveyor belt to cast a
shadow representing the size of the book onto an overhead camera. When the book
passes in front of an appropriately sized pusher, the pusher pushes an
alignment rectangle forward to align the book and slide the book off the
conveyor belt onto a slide that takes the book to a clipping station capable of
clipping books of that size. The clipped book is then moved to the kitting area
for loading into a storage tray that can accept books of that size.
